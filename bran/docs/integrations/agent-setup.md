# Agent setup

BRAN works offline without an account. Connecting an agent is optional and does
not change the repository index. Install an exact sealed BRAN release, then copy
`skill/use-bran` into the skill directory used by the agent host. If the host
uses a nonstandard location, set `BRAN_SKILL_PATH` to the copied `SKILL.md` only
for the doctor invocation. BRAN reports whether it can discover the file; it
does not modify global host settings.

Credentials belong in the host's credential store or documented environment
input. BRAN has no command-line credential option, and setup output must not
contain credential material.

## Journey 1: Offline repository guide

1. Run `bran tui`, choose the Quick flow, and review the resolved configuration.
   The safe default is offline, read-only, SQZ requested, voice and saved chat
   off, and zero-conversation retention. Uninstalled features remain
   `unavailable`.
2. Apply the settings, then run `bran doctor --onboarding`. Check `ready`,
   `settings_status`, the requested/effective capability states, and the offline
   return proof. The diagnostic must report zero provider, auth, and network
   calls.
3. Use deterministic retrieval directly:

   ```sh
   bran packet <repo-root> "<request>"
   bran query <repo-root> "<request>"
   ```

No generated answer is expected. Preserve provenance and label byte-derived
token counts as estimates.

## Journey 2: Optional connected task and removal

1. Reopen TUI settings and select Connected Agent. Review every unavailable or
   locked choice before applying. The configurable connected-task total-token
   ceiling defaults to exactly 8,500. It is not proven effective until the host
   adapter attests enforcement; otherwise the doctor and task receipts must say
   `unavailable`.
2. Inspect registered profiles and local readiness:

   ```sh
   bran agents list
   bran doctor --agent
   ```

   `doctor` checks local CLI and skill discovery, persisted workspace policy,
   SQZ capability, a deterministic packet round trip, and host attestation. It
   does not initialize a provider, network, or credential store just to probe a
   capability. Local setup may be ready while connected execution remains
   unavailable; in that state the command exits with validation status rather
   than claiming overall readiness.
3. Choose a profile from `agents list`. Reasoning accepts exactly
   `off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh`; tools are limited to `read,search`:

   ```sh
   bran -p --agent <profile> --reasoning medium --tools read,search "review this change"
   bran -p --agent <profile> --reasoning low --no-session "find the owning specification"
   ```

   Read the whole receipt. Requested and effective profile, model, reasoning,
   and tool policy are distinct; an unattested effective value stays
   `unavailable`. `--no-session` requests no conversation session, while result
   receipts and explicitly referenced artifacts remain governed by their own
   bounded retention rules.
4. Disable Connected Agent in TUI settings, or prove the same boundary directly:

   ```sh
   bran -p --agent <profile> --offline --no-session "offline return proof"
   bran packet <repo-root> "<request>"
   ```

   The first command must return a typed incomplete offline receipt, not a
   generated answer. The following packet remains deterministic and must not
   initialize provider, auth, or network ports.

## Reading unavailable results

Unavailable is a result, not a silent fallback. Keep using offline retrieval,
repair the missing local setup, or connect a separately reviewed host adapter.
Do not claim effective reasoning, SQZ, token enforcement, or generated output
from requested settings alone.
